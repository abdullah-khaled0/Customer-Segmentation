## üöÄ Problem
In this project, we delve deep into the thriving sector of online retail by analyzing a transactional dataset from a UK-based retailer, available at the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. This dataset documents all transactions between **2010 and 2011**. 

Our primary objective is to **amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales** through **customer segmentation**. We aim to transform the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by **creating new features** that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the **K-means clustering algorithm**.

This segmentation will allow us to **understand the distinct profiles and preferences of different customer groups**. Building upon this, we intend to **develop a recommendation system** that will suggest **top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet**, ultimately **enhancing marketing efficacy and fostering increased sales**.

## üéØ Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for effective clustering.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.
4. **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
5. **Cluster Analysis & Evaluation**: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.
6. **Recommendation System**: Implement a system to recommend best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven't purchased those products, aiming to boost sales and marketing effectiveness.
